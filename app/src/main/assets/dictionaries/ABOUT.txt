Scrabble(tm) Dictionaries
=========================

The official Scrabble player's dictionary, known as OSPD, is widely available on the internet.
There is also a list targeted at Scrabble players known as the Enable list. This has been
explicitly placed in the public domain. The Enable list is much more comprehensive than OSPD;
you can read the authors' comments if you are interested. We have left their comments exactly
as found, so a couple of references (e.g. to SIGWORDS.LST) do not make sense in this context.
Note that OSPD contains no words over 8 letters; one reason that the Enable list is so much
larger is that it includes longer words (which are of course much less likely to be used
in Scrabble).

    * OSPD – 79,338 entries
    * Enable – 172,823 entries

NI2--Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition
===========================================================

The two NI2 word lists are known as “web2” and “web2a”, and have both been widely available for a
long time. They are collectively known as the “Air Force” lists. You may be interested in
information we received from Doug McIlroy about the origin of both these lists and the Unix
dictionary (see below). The first contains all single words from NI2; the second, all compound
forms. Not every word in NI2 is here; not every word here is in NI2. The correspondence is
very close for web2, but not so good for web2a–there are many NI2 compound entries missing
from web2a. In addition, there are many inflected forms missing from these lists.
However, for NPL purposes these two lists are invaluable since they cover the largest
current reference very well.

These lists are mixed case.

    * Single words – 234,936 entries
    * Compound forms – 76, 205 entries
