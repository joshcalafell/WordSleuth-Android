    <string name="txt_instructions_page1">This app is designed to easily help users find anagrams,
        subwords, or word combinations that can be made from a set of letters. You could find an
        anagram of your name or other things, or use it as an aid for crosswords or games like
        Words With Friends(TM), or Scrabble(TM)...

    <string name="txt_instructions_page2">To find anagrams, simply type the letters of names, or
        a words you are curious about. For games like Scrabble(TM) or Words With Friends(TM),

        the work for you...

    <string name="txt_instructions_page3">Sub-words are words that can be made with the letters
        provided, but are not full anagrams. They have 1 or more letters left over. Finding
        subwords is easy with Word Sleuth. They will appear as an option in a list to
        view when a query is submitted, along with anagrams, and combinations, if any are found...

    <string name="txt_instructions_page5">Sometimes you don\'t know all the letters for a
        query, such as in a crossword, or in other games with blank letters. You can substitute
